# Exploring Spring Boot Fundamentals

## Overview
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development environment before Spring Boot, followed by building a REST API using Spring Boot. It highlights key Spring Boot features like Starter Projects, Auto-Configuration, Developer Tools, Actuator, and more. This journey demonstrates how Spring Boot simplifies Java development, especially in building production-ready REST APIs with minimal configuration.

### 1. Understanding the World Before Spring Boot

Before Spring Boot, setting up a Spring project for production was a complex and time-consuming task. Developers had to manually configure many aspects of the application to make it fully functional. Here are some of the key challenges:

- **Dependency Management**  
  Managing dependencies in a Spring project required manual configuration in Maven or Gradle files. Each library, including Spring itself, had to be correctly specified with compatible versions. This often resulted in version conflicts or dependency issues.

- **Web Application Configuration (web.xml)**  
  Setting up a web application required a `web.xml` file for configuration, which specified servlet mappings, listeners, and other setup needed for web applications. This process was cumbersome and error-prone.

- **Spring Configuration & Bean Management**  
  Configuring Spring involved defining beans, dependencies, and application context, usually through XML or Java-based configuration. This required developers to understand the entire bean lifecycle and dependency injection configuration, which was not always straightforward.

- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**  
  Implementing non-functional requirements like logging, monitoring, security, and exception handling needed additional setup and often required third-party tools or custom configurations, adding more complexity to the project setup.

With Spring Boot, these configurations became more manageable through convention over configuration, auto-configuration, and a more streamlined project setup.

### 2. Create a Spring Boot Project

Spring Boot simplifies project creation with its **Starter Projects**. Using the Spring Initializr or any modern IDE, we can quickly generate a Spring Boot project with all necessary dependencies pre-configured. This means minimal setup and faster bootstrapping, allowing developers to focus on coding rather than configuration.

In this project, we will demonstrate how to set up a Spring Boot application using the following features:
- **Spring Boot Starters** for dependency management
- **Auto-Configuration** for component initialization
- **Developer Tools** for enhanced productivity
- **Actuator** for monitoring and metrics

### 3. Build a Simple REST API Using Spring Boot

Using Spring Boot, creating RESTful web services is simple and straightforward. We’ll build a basic REST API with a single endpoint as an example. Spring Boot’s **embedded server** (Tomcat) and **auto-configuration** allow us to create and deploy the API without complex setup.

Our REST API includes:
- **GET endpoint** to retrieve data
- **Controller** to handle requests
- **Service layer** to handle business logic

By the end of this project, you’ll have a foundational understanding of Spring Boot’s capabilities and how they ease the development of RESTful APIs in Java.
