In a Spring Boot application, "deployment using embedded servers" means that the application comes with a built-in web server
(like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow).
This server is packaged inside the application's JAR file, so you don't need to install or configure an external server separately.

When you start the Spring Boot application, it automatically starts the embedded server, allowing the app to run as a standalone service.
This makes deployment simpler because you only need to run the application JAR, and itâ€™s ready to handle web requests without
needing any extra setup on a server.

To Deploy :
1. Install Java
2. Run JAR File

Right click on your project -> Run As > Maven build...
Goals : clean install

Open Console Logs : Copy the path of jar in Building jar.
And also check spring-boot-starter-tomcat (Default) is coming from spring-boot-starter-web

Embedded Servers Examples :
spring-boot-starter-tomcat
spring-boot-starter-jetty
spring-boot-starter-undertow

cmd ->
cd PATH
dir
java --version (Need at-least java 17)
java -jar JAR_NAME
