Spring Boot Actuator provides several useful endpoints for monitoring and managing applications in real-life production.
Here are some of the key Actuator endpoints that can be valuable in a production environment:

1. /actuator/health
Purpose: Provides the health status of the application.
Usage: Shows whether the application is up or down and, when configured, provides insights into the health of various components
(like database connections, caches, etc.).
It's often used by monitoring tools to check if the app is healthy.
Example Output: { "status": "UP" }

2. /actuator/info
Purpose: Displays general application information.
Usage: Commonly used to show basic application metadata, such as version, environment, and any custom information that developers choose to add.
This is useful for tracking version releases in production.
Example Output: { "version": "1.0.0", "description": "My Application" }

3. /actuator/metrics
Purpose: Provides various application metrics.
Usage: Offers detailed performance metrics (like memory usage, CPU usage, active threads, etc.).
This data is invaluable for performance monitoring and diagnostics.
Example Output: { "names": ["jvm.memory.used", "jvm.threads.live", "system.cpu.usage"] }
Example Specific Metric: /actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.used

4. /actuator/loggers
Purpose: Allows for viewing and modifying logging levels.
Usage: Shows the current logging levels for all loggers, and you can dynamically change the level for specific packages or
classes in real-time without restarting the application.
Example to Change Logging Level: POST /actuator/loggers/com.example with { "configuredLevel": "DEBUG" }

5. /actuator/env
Purpose: Exposes the environment properties of the application.
Usage: Helpful for viewing environment details, including configuration properties from application.properties, system properties,
and environment variables. Can be used to troubleshoot configuration issues.
Example Output: { "propertySources": [ { "name": "applicationConfig: [classpath:/application.properties]", "properties": { ... } } ] }

6. /actuator/beans
Purpose: Shows all Spring beans in the application context.
Usage: Useful for debugging by providing insight into the beans that are currently loaded, their dependencies, and their scopes.
Example Output: { "contexts": { "application": { "beans": { "dataSource": { "type": "org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSource", "scope": "singleton" } } } }

7. /actuator/mappings
Purpose: Lists all endpoint mappings in the application.
Usage: Useful for debugging routing issues by providing details about all available endpoints and the controllers responsible for them.
Example Output: { "/api/v1/users": { "handler": "UserController.getAllUsers" } }

8. /actuator/threaddump (or /actuator/threaddump for JVM monitoring)
Purpose: Provides a thread dump of the JVM.
Usage: Helpful for diagnosing thread-related issues by providing details about active threads and their states,
especially useful during high CPU or deadlock scenarios.
Example Output: Contains detailed thread information, such as state, stack trace, etc.

9. /actuator/heapdump
Purpose: Generates a heap dump of the application.
Usage: Useful for deep memory analysis. This endpoint provides a snapshot of the heap, which can be used with tools like
Eclipse MAT to analyze memory usage and troubleshoot memory leaks.
Output: Generates a .hprof file for memory analysis.

10. /actuator/shutdown (disabled by default for security)
Purpose: Allows graceful shutdown of the application.
Usage: Useful for scenarios where you need to stop the application safely without external tools.
Note that this endpoint should be carefully protected or disabled in production, as it can shut down the application remotely.

Security Considerations
In production, it's essential to protect these endpoints with proper security, such as authentication and authorization.
Only expose necessary endpoints publicly, while others should be restricted or accessible only via internal networks.
Using these endpoints effectively can help monitor, manage, and troubleshoot Spring Boot applications in production with minimal configuration.


# To enable the /actuator/shutdown endpoint in a Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

Update application.properties

By default, the shutdown endpoint is disabled for security reasons.
You can enable it by adding the following line to your application.properties file:
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true

Ensure Proper Security Configuration:

Since the /actuator/shutdown endpoint can remotely stop the application, itâ€™s crucial to secure it.
This might involve adding authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
For example, if using Spring Security, make sure access is restricted, perhaps to admin users only.
Access the Endpoint:

After enabling, you can access the shutdown endpoint via a POST request:

POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/shutdown
This request will gracefully shut down the application.

Note: Be careful using this in production.
You may want to restrict access to this endpoint to only trusted IPs or keep it disabled unless absolutely necessary.
